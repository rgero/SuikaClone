# Suika Fruit
---

This is a small project in which I quickly recreated the Suika Fruit game, a popular game that's on the Nintendo Switch and the Web. It was meant to be something that I worked on over the holidays.

The goal wasn't to recreate the game in its entirety, but to replicate the game mechanics. Once that was achieved, the progress on this stalled a fair bit. I might revisit this further to make the graphics a bit better, or to experiment with some other features.
